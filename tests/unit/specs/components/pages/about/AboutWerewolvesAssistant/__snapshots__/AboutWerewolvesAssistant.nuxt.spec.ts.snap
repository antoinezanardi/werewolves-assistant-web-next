  <p id="about-werewolves-assistant-disclaimer-first-section">The Werewolves Assistant has no intention of replacing the original Werewolves of Miller's Hollowâ„¢ game. Its use requires prior possession of a game with its cards.</p>
  <p id="about-werewolves-assistant-disclaimer-second-section">It is important to emphasize that the Assistant positions itself as an exclusive aid to the game master, facilitating game management without altering the essence and experience unique to the original board game. Thus, it complements and enhances the game's dynamics while preserving its authentic character.</p>
