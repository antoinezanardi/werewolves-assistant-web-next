  <p id="about-creator-second-section">For me, Werewolves of Miller's Hollowâ„¢ game is one of the best games to play with friends or family around a table, where alliances and betrayals intertwine, much like in Mario Kart. As the game progresses, the true nature of each player is revealed, masks fall, and everyone feels threatened. Each game is a unique adventure, full of unexpected twists.</p>
  <p id="about-creator-third-section">As a big fan of the game master role, I've always wanted to share the rewarding feeling of being the conductor during a game. So, I created this assistant so that anyone can take on this important role, in any game configuration.</p>
  <p id="about-creator-forth-section">Your feedback on this assistant is welcome. It was created to serve all game masters, whether novice or expert, and make your games memorable. Have fun!</p>
